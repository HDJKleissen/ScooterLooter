  intro: While travelling you hear a loud clanking. Upon inspection you see a humongous
    muscled man sitting in the back car. "GIVE ME", he shouts. "GIVE ME, GIVE ME".
  choice1:
    decision: We will give him the whooping of his life! No stowaways allowed!
    outro: You try to eject the large man, though in the end you have to decouple
      the entire car he was in. The car housed a bunch of your supplies, which you
      have to leave behind to rid yourself of the angry stowaway. -<color=#FF0000>3</color><sprite

    decision: Try to placate the giant with a Teddy Bear
    outro: You try a hail Mary and throw your teddy bear into the car with the giant.
      "RUXPIN!" he bellows. He nearly squeezes the life out of Ruxpin before leaping
      of the back of the train, dissappearing into the country side.
